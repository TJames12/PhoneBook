Problem #6

An online phone book company has hired you to implement their automated address book to store name
and telephone number information on every household in town. The address book should be able to
search by either name or telephone number, returning the other. Note that a telephone number may
correspond to multiple people (everyone in the same household) and that a name may correspond to
multiple phone numbers (common names or people with multiple phone numbers). Your system must
also be able to print out a list of all the names in alphabetical order or all the phone numbers in numeric
order.
